<abstract>
<t>
		This memo provides a guide for building a PKI (Public Key
		Infrastructure) using openSSL.  All certificates in this guide
		are ECDSA, P-256, with SHA256 certificates.  Along with common
		End Entity certificates, this guide provides instructions for
		creating IEEE 802.1AR iDevID Secure Device certificates.
</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
		The IETF has a plethora of security solutions targeted at IoT.
		Yet all too many IoT products are deployed with no or
		improperly configured security.  In particular resource
		constrained IoT devices and non-IP IoT networks have not been
		well served in the IETF.
</t>
<t>
		Additionally, more IETF (e.g. DOTS, NETCONF) efforts are
		requiring secure identities, but are vague on the nature of
		these identities other than to recommend use of X.509 digital
		certificates and perhaps TLS.
</t>
<t>
		This effort provides the steps, using the openSSL application,
		to create such a PKI of ECDSA certificates.  The goal is that
		any developer or tester can follow these steps, create the
		basic objects needed and establish the validity of the
		standard/program design.  This guide can even be used to create
		a production PKi, though additional steps need to be taken.
		This could be very useful to a small vendor needing to include
		<xref target="IEEE.802.1AR_2009">802.1AR</xref> iDevIDs in
		their product.
</t>
<t>
		This guide was tested with openSSL 1.1.0f on Fedora 26 and
		creates PEM-based certificates.  DER based certificates fails
		(see <xref target="DER" />).

<section anchor="BasicPKI" title="The Basic PKI feature set">
<t>
	A basic pki has two levels of hierarchy: Root and Intermediate. The
	Root level has the greatest risk, and is the least used.  It only
	signs the Intermediate level signing certificate.  As such, once
	the Root level is created and signs the Intermediate level
	certificate it can be locked up.  In fact, the Root level could
	exist completely on a mSD boot card for an ARM small computer like
	a RaspberryPi.  A copy of this card can be made and securely stored
	in a different location.
</t>
<t>
	The Root level contains the Root certificate private key, a
	database of all signed certificates, and  the public certificate.
	It can also contain the Intermediate level public certificate and a
	Root level CRL.
</t>
<t>
	The Intermediate level contains the Intermediate certificate
	private key, the public certificate, a database of all signed
	certificates, the certificate trust chain, and Intermediate level
	CRL.  It can also contain the End Entity public certificates.  The
	private key file needs to be keep securely.  For example as with
	the Root level, a mSD image for an ARM computer could contain the
	complete Intermediate level. This image is kept offline.  The End
	Entity CSR is copied to it, signed, and then the signed certificate
	and updated database are moved to the public image that lacks the
	private key.
</t>
<t>
	For a simple test pki, all files can be kept on a single system
	that is managed by the tester.
</t>
<t>
	End Entities create a key pair and a Certificate Signing Request
	(CSR).  The private key is stored securely.  The CSR is delivered
	to the Intermediate level which uses the CSR to create the End
	Entity certificate.  This certificate, along with the trust chain
	back to the root, is then returned to the End Entity.
</t>
<t>
	There is more to a pki, but this suffices for most development and
	testing needs.
</t>

<section anchor="RootLevel" title="Getting started and the Root level">
<t>
    This guide was developed on a Fedora 26 armv7hl system (Cubieboard2
    SoC).  It should work on most Linux and similar systems.  All work
    was done in a terminal window with extensive "cutting and pasting"
    from a draft guide into the terminal window.  Users of this guide
    may find different behaviors based on their system.

<section anchor="Footnotes" title="Footnotes">
<t>
	Creating this document was a real education in the state of
	openSSL, X.509 certificate guidance, and just general level of
	certificate awareness.  Here are a few short notes.
</t>
<section anchor="SerNum" title="Certificate Serial Number">
<t>
	The certificate serial number's role is to provide yet another way
	to maintain uniqueness of certificates within a pki as well as a
	way to index them in a data store.  It has taken on other roles,
	most notably as a defense.
</t>
<t>
	The CABForum guideline for a public CA is for the serial number to
	be a random number at least 8 octets long and no longer than 20
	bytes. By default, openssl makes self-signed certificates with 8
	octet serial numbers.  This guide uses openssl's RAND function to
	generate the random value and pipe it into the -set_serial option.
	This number MAY have the first bit as a ONE; the DER encoding rules
	prepend such numbers with 0x00.  Thus the limit of '19' for the
	variable 'ns'.
</t>
<t>
	A private CA need not follow the CABForum rules and can use
	anything number for the serial number.  For example, the root CA
	(which has no security risks mitigated by using a random value)
	could use '1' as its serial number.  Intermediate and End Entity
	certificate serial numbers can also be of any value if a strong
	hash, like SHA256 used here.  A value of 4 for ns would provide a
	sufficient population so that a CA of 10,000 EE certificates will
	have only a 1.2% probability of a collision.  For only 1,000
	certificates the probability drops to 0.012%.
</t>
<t>
	The following was proposed on the openssl-user list as an
	alternative to using the RAND function:
</t>
<t>
	Keep k bits (k/8 octets) long serial numbers for all your
	certificates, chose a block cipher operating on blocks of k bits,
	and operate this block cipher in CTR mode, with a proper secret key
	and secret starting counter. That way, no collision detection is
	necessary, you’ll be able to generate 2^(k/2) unique k bits longs
	serial numbers (in fact, you can generate 2^k unique serial
	numbers, but after 2^(k/2) you lose some security guarantees).
</t>
<t>
	With 3DES, k=64, and with AES, k=128.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="Config" title="Some OpenSSL config file limitations">
<t>
	There is a bit of inconsistency in how different parts and fields
	in the config file are used.  Environment variables can only be
	used as values.  Some fields can have null values, others cannot.
	The lack of allowing null fields means a script cannot feed in an
	environment variable with value null.  In such a case, the field
	has to be removed from the config file.
</t>
<t>
	The expectation is each CA within a PKI has its own config file,
	customized to the certificates supported by that CA.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="SAN" title="subjectAltName support, or lack thereof">
<t>
	There is no direct openssl command line option to provide a
	subjectAltName for a certificate.  This is a serious limitation.
	Per <xref target="RFC5280">RFC 5280</xref> SAN is the object for
	providing email addresses and DNS addresses (FQDN), yet the common
	practice has been to use the commonName object within the
	distinguishedName object.  How much of this is due to the
	difficulty in creating certificates with a SAN?
</t>
<t>
	Thus the only way to provide a SAN is through the config file.  And
	there are two approaches.  This document uses an environment
	variable to provide the SAN value into the config file.  Another
	approach is to use piping as in:
<figure>
INSERT_TEXT_FROM_FILE scripts/san-creation-pipe.sh END
</figure>
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="CriticalSAN" title="Certificates with only subjectAltName">
<t>
	Also in <xref target="RFC5280">RFC 5280</xref> (sec 4.2.1.6):  if
	the only subject identity in the certificate is in subjectAltName,
	then Subject MUST be empty and subjectAltName MUST be marked as
	critical.
</t>
<t>
	This can be achieved with the variable DN=/ and subjectAltName
	(example given):
</t>
<figure> <artwork>

DN=/
export subjectAltName=critical,email:postmaster@htt-consult.com

</artwork> </figure>
</section>
<section anchor="DER" title="DER support, or lack thereof">
<t>
	The long, hard-fought battle with openssl to create a full DER pki
	failed.  The is no facility to create a DER certificate from a DER
	CSR.  It just is not there in the 'openssl ca' command.  Even the
	'openssl x509 -req' command cannot do this for a simple certificate.
</t>
<t>
	Further, there is no 'hack' for making a certificate chain as there
	is with PEM.  With PEM a simple concatenation of the certificates
	create a usable certificate chain.  For DER, some recommend using
	<xref target="RFC2315">PKCS#7</xref>, where others point out that
	this format is poorly support 'in the field', whereas <xref
	target="RFC7292">PKCS#12</xref> works for them.
</t>
<t>
	Finally, openssl does supports converting a PEM certificate to DER:
<figure> <artwork><![CDATA[

openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der

]]></artwork> </figure>
	This should also work for the keypair.  However, in a highly
	constrained device it may make more sense to just store the raw
	keypair in the device's very limited secure storage.
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
        TBD.  May be nothing for IANA.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<section anchor="Randomness" title="Adequate Randomness">
<t>
	Creating certificates takes a lot of random numbers.  A good source
	of random numbers is critical.  <xref
	target="WeakKeys">Studies</xref> have found excessive amount of
	certificates, all with the same keys due to bad randomness on the
	generating systems.  The amount of entropy available for these
	random numbers can be tested.  On Fedora/Centos and most Linux systems use:
<figure> <artwork><![CDATA[
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
]]></artwork> </figure>
</t>
<t>
	If the value is low (below 1000) check your system's randomness
	source.  Is rng-tools installed?  Consider adding an entropy
	collection service like haveged from issihosts.com/haveged.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="Theft" title="Key pair Theft">
<t>
	During the certificate creation, particularly during keypair
	generation, the files are vulnerable to theft.  This can be
	mitigate using umask.  Before using openssl, set umask:
<figure> <artwork><![CDATA[
restore_mask=$(umask -p)
umask 077
]]></artwork> </figure>
	Afterwards, restore it with:
<figure> <artwork><![CDATA[
$restore_mask
]]></artwork> </figure>
or just close the shell that was used, and start a new one.  (The -p option to umask is a bash-ism)
</t>
<t>
There is nothing in these recipes that requires super-user on the system creating the
certificates.  Provided that adequate randomness is available, a virtual machine or container
is entirely appropriate.  Containers tend to have better access to randomness than virtual
machines.
</t>
<t>
The scripts and configuration files and in particular, private keys, may be kept offline
on a USB key for instance, and loaded when needed.
</t>
<t>
The OCSP server needs to be online and available to all clients that will use the
certificates. This may mean available on the Internet.  A firewall can protect the
OCSP server, and port-forwards and/or ACL rules can restrict access to just the OCSP port.
OCSP artifacts are signed by a key designed for that purpose only so do not require that
the associated CA key be available online.
</t>
<t>
Generating new CRLs, however, requires that the CA signing key be online, which is one of
the reasons for creating an intermediate CA.

	This work was jump started by the excellent RSA pki guide by Jamie
	Nguyen.  The openssl-user mailing list, with its many supportive
	experts; in particular:  Rich Salz, Jakob Bolm, Viktor Dukhovni,
	and Erwann Abalea, was of immense help as was the openssl man pages
	website.
</t>
<t>
	Finally, "Professor Google" was always ready to point to answers to
	questions like: "openssl subjectAltName on the command line".  And
	the Professor, it seems, never tires of answering even trivial
	questions.
